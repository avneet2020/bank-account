This project leverages the Spring Framework to create the back end for a banking managment system.
Spring JPA is used to contain the data models present as well as maintain Repositories for the models.
JPA also provides communcation technqiues between the face of the bank and the database behind it.
I have incorporated RESTful endpoints to facilitate HTTP requests with the front end of the bank.
The endpoints created are for This controller exposes various RESTful endpoints for:
registration, login, updating customer information, updating balance, retrieving users, and deleting users.
I have used Maven manage dependencies.

The front end part of this project uses React.js to create a minimal face to the bank.
I wrote this code using TypeScript and had 3 major components.
Login, Register, Welcome.
For styling, I used BootStrap.
